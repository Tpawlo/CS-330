How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

When designing software, I try to think of the big picture, and the smaller steps that I need to take to get there. Since the beginning, I knew what the requirements were for the final project and I knew what type of scene I wanted to create, but each week, I focused on the smaller steps that I would need to learn and complete in order to meet those requirements. By pacing out the work for this project, I was better able to understand the concepts and get the work done without being too overwhelmed. I used the resources and sample code provided to help me design and program the software, which helped me understand what needs to be done and why in order to get the finished project. Taking a project step-by-step will really help me manage my future projects as well. 




How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I found that for this project, taking small steps each week with the milestones really helped me manage and understand the requirements for the final project. When it came to finishing and submitting the final project, I was not too stressed since I had already began working on the project and only had to do some finishing touches. By taking small steps each week, it really helped me understand the content better than I have in other classes where the content is rushed or does not go through it step-by-step. I would like to use this type of method in the future when working on projects to help them be more manageable and less overwhelming. By iterating the work each week, I truly thought I was getting a better grasp on this course's content and I felt the pace was just right. 




How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

In pursuing a degree in computer science, this will help me reach my goal in obtaining a career in the computer science field. Although I think I plan on entering into more of a data science field, it is beneficial both educationally and profesionally to get experience in all areas of computer science. Computational graphics and visualizations was a very interesting class and I learned a lot of new techniques and practices in it. This allowed me to learn skills and practices that will help me whether I go into a grpahics field or not. In addition, I would love to learn more about graphics and may decide to take another course on it in the future.
